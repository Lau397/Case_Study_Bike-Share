# Cyclistic

This repository is a creation of a basic data analysis using Jupyter Notebook, for a company that provides transportation services using bikes as their means and is looking to expand the amount of members, by analyzing the data for both users registered: member and casual.

The notebook contains my analysis of this data, having a data cleaning process described and plots/graphs included to investigate what could be helpful for the company to implement or improve so more casual users become actual anual members.

No need to run any Python script. 

üçï DA_Cyclistic.ipynb is the Jupyter Notebook that contains the data analysis with the description of the process there
üçï DA_Cyclistic_report.md is the project final report
