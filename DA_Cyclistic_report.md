# **Study Case: Cyclistic**

*Company's description:* Cyclistic is a bike-share company in Chicago that'd like to grow its success through maximizing the number of annual memberships.

As part of Cyclistic's marketing strategy they created flexible pricing plans:
 - single-ride passes

## Data sources
The data selected is from February 2023 available at: https://divvy-tripdata.s3.amazonaws.com/index.html
In which the trip data such as; started_at, ended_at, start_station_id, end_station_id, geolocation, among others is registered in an Excel file.

The data seems reliable in a way that values make sense and that, generally, it is consistent in each column of data registered. The data is also very recent at the moment of writing this and the information registered in the file is easy to understand.
